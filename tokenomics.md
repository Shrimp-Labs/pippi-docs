## $xPIPI

**25% of PIPI emissions** are distributed to xPIPI holders every block. Users can claim these rewards and re-invest them.

PIPI holders can swap PIPI for xPIPI at a 1:1 ratio.

PIPI is distributed proportionally at each block based on xPIPI holdings.

xPIPI is also used to earn tokens from xPIPI Pools \(Coming soon\).

## **Token Deflation Model**

The chefs aim to make deflation higher than emission by building deflationary mechanisms into Pippi Shrimp Swap's products. The goal is for more SHRIMP to leave circulation than the amount of SHRIMP that's produced.

**Reducing block emissions**

By reducing the amount of $PIPI made per block, we slow inflation. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, for the same reason we don't want a hard cap: we still need to incentivize people to provide liquidity.

**Deflationary mechanisms**

Regular token burns \(view burn address\) are built into many of Pippi Shrimp Swap's products \(like a 10% burn of $PIPI spent on lottery tickets\), with more on the way. Check the $PIPI Tokenomics page for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.
