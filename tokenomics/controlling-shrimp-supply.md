# Controlling SHRIMP supply

## **Why SHRIMP has no hard cap**

There's currently no hard cap on the supply of SHRIMP token, making it an inflationary token.

Community members often point to this as a cause for concern, and while the chefs certainly understand the wish for a hard cap, there's a big reason we don't expect to set one in the near future:

SHRIMP's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity to the exchange. Without block rewards, there would be much less incentive to provide liquidity \(LP fees etc. would remain\).

So what are the other ways SHRIMP's supply is limited, to counter inflation?

## **How SHRIMP supply is reduced without a hard cap**

The chefs aim to making deflation higher than emission by building deflationary mechanisms into Shrimpswap's products. The goal is for more SHRIMP to leave circulation than the amount of SHRIMP that's produced.

**Reducing block emissions**

By reducing the amount of SHRIMP made per block, we slow inflation. This has already been done once: The first reduction in block emissions effectively reduced the number of SHRIMP produced from 40 SHRIMP per block to 25. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, for the same reason we don't want a hard cap: we still need to incentivize people to provide liquidity.

**Deflationary mechanisms**

Regular token burns \(view burn address\) are built into many of ShrimpSwap's products \(like a 10% burn of SHRIMP spent on lottery tickets\), with more on the way. Check the SHRIMP Tokenomics page for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.
