# $PIPI Deflation Model

## **Why $PIPI has no hard cap**

There's currently no hard cap on the supply of $PIPI token, making it an inflationary token.

Community members often point to this as a cause for concern, and while the chefs certainly understand the wish for a hard cap, there's a big reason we don't expect to set one in the near future:

$PIPI's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity to the exchange. Without block rewards, there would be much less incentive to provide liquidity \(LP fees etc. would remain\).

So what are the other ways $PIPI's supply is limited, to counter inflation?

## **How $PIPI supply is reduced without a hard cap**

The chefs aim to making deflation higher than emission by building deflationary mechanisms into Pippi Shrimp Swap's products. The goal is for more SHRIMP to leave circulation than the amount of SHRIMP that's produced.

**Reducing block emissions**

By reducing the amount of $PIPI made per block, we slow inflation. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, for the same reason we don't want a hard cap: we still need to incentivize people to provide liquidity.

**Deflationary mechanisms**

Regular token burns \(view burn address\) are built into many of Pippi Shrimp Swap's products \(like a 10% burn of $PIPI spent on lottery tickets\), with more on the way. Check the $PIPI Tokenomics page for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.
