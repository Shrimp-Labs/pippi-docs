## Why Huobi ECO Chain \(HECO\)? 

In very simple terms, why would we want to drive a slower car that costs more to run? We are all about gamification, so we want to maximize the feedback loop of earning, staking, and earning again: and all these and more can be achieved by HECO's \(Huobi ECO\) superior speed and much more \(amazingly insane\) low transaction fees. Admittedly, while HECO might not have the level of adoption Ethereum does at the moment, Huobi‚Äôs ability and drive as it continues on this right track will reduce the difference as the adoption of Huobi grows in the for seeable future.
