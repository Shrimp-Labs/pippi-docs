## About Exchange​

Token swaps on ShrimpSwap are a simple way to trade one token for another via automated liquidity pools.

The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers \("LPs"\) who stake their tokens in "Pools". In exchange, they get SLIP \(ShrimpSwap Liquidity Provider\) tokens, which can also be staked to earn SHRIMP tokens in the "farm".

When you make a token swap \(trade\) on the exchange you will pay a 0.2% trading fee, which is broken down as follows:

0.17% - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

0.03% - Sent to the ShrimpSwap Treasury.
