# Pippi Yield Farms

PIPI Yiled Farm is the platform which is a yield optimizer that moves funds around the decentralized finance \(“defi”\) ecosystem in an effort to generate a high return.

## Core Products

### Vaults

Capital pools that automatically generate yield based on opportunities present in the market. Vaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have a proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy.

### Earn

The first Yearn product is based on [**CherrySwap** **Farms**](https://www.cherryswap.net/farms/). Funds are farmed in cherry Farms and auto compounds **EVERY HOUR**. Users can deposit to these yield farming pools smart contracts via the yield page. This product completely optimizes the interest accrual process for end-users to ensure they are obtaining the highest interest rates at all times among the platforms specified above.
