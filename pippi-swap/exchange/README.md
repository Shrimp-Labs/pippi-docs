# Pippi Swap

## About Exchangeâ€‹

Token swaps on Pippi Finance are a simple way to trade one token for another via automated liquidity pools. The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers \(LPs\) who stake their tokens in "Pools". In exchange, they get SLP \(ShrimpSwap Liquidity Provider\) tokens, which can also be staked to earn $PIPI tokens in the "farm".
