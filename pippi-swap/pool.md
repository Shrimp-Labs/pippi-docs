## **Syrup Pools**

Syrup Pools: where sweet, new tokens meet the Pippi Shrimp Swap community!

Syrup Pools allow Huobi ECO Chain projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to $PIPI token holders. Syrup Pool is split into two sections: Core and Community.

Core will be initially selected by the Pippi Shrimp Swap team while Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any project will be able to distribute tokens via Syrup Pool, but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option \(in order to discourage scams\).
