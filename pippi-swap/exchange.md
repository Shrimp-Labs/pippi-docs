## About Exchangeâ€‹


Token swaps on Pippi Finance are a simple way to trade one token for another via automated liquidity pools. The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers \(LPs\) who stake their tokens in "Pools". In exchange, they get SLIP \(ShrimpSwap Liquidity Provider\) tokens, which can also be staked to earn $PIPI tokens in the "farm".

When a token swap \(trade\) is conducted on the exchange, there is 0.2% trading fee, which is broken down as follows:

**0.15%** - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers

**0.05%** - Sent to the Pippi Finance Treasury
