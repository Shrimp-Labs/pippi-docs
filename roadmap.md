## **CORE**

Pippi Finance has as part of its product and services delivery the following products which are all painstakingly designed to ensure users of each of the products get the best out of them.

These are:

Pippi SWAP

xPIPI POOLS

## Liquidity protection 

**Pippi Swap** v2 will design liquidity protection mechanism so that a **liquidity** provider always gets back the same value he/she originally deposits plus trading fees through a novel concept called Impermanent Loss Insurance. Impermanent Loss Insurance accrues over time, by 1% each day, until 100% **protection** is achieved after xx days in the pool.

## **Other products**

Not limiting itself in terms of innovation, Shrimp equally has the following:

**NFT Ecosystem**: The Non-Fungicide Token ecosystem allows users to mint, trade, and do much more as these services and more can all be paid in $PIPI.

**IDO**: Users can raise funds for their project in $PIPI-HT LP tokens. After redeeming the LP tokens, the HT is distributed to the project and the $PIPI is burned.

**Lending & Borrowing**: Lend and borrow HECO and LP tokens - $PIPI provides a rate discount that is affordable and has an easy pay-back option.

**Margin Trading**: Users can trade HECO tokens with leverage on-chain â€” periodic $PIPI buyback and burn options.

Apart from the above, other products are Lottery, Analytics, and Voting.
