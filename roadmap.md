## **Other products**

Not limiting itself in terms of innovation, Shrimp equally has the following:

**IDO**: Users can raise funds for their project in $PIPI-HT LP tokens. After redeeming the LP tokens, the HT is distributed to the project and the $PIPI is burned.

**Lending & Borrowing**: Lend and borrow HECO and LP tokens - $PIPI provides rate discount which is affordable and has an easy pay-back options.

**Margin Trading**: Users can trade HECO tokens with leverage on-chain â€” periodic $PIPI buyback and burn options.

**NFT Ecosystem**: The Non-Fungicide Token ecosystem allows users to mint, trade, and do much more as these services and more can all be paid in $PIPI.

Apart from the above, other products are Lottery, Analytics and Voting.
